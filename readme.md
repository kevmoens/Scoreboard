# NFL Scoreboard
Is a user interface that displays the current score between 2 NFL teams.  Easy to use buttons to update the score and able which can be done on the display or through a remote page so users don't have to see updates done by a user.

Goal is to Share Core logic between UWP and Blazor App to avoid duplicate code and prove SOLID principles.
The Blazor App uses SignalR to update all other Blazor instances.
The UWP App was developed to run on Windows IOT Raspberry Pi 3 B+.
